        <h1>Met Masquerade</h1>
        <p>An AR Experience by <a href="http://danranpresent.com" target="_blank">Dan Ran</a></p>
      </div>
      <p><br>This is an AR interactive experience prototype based on the Met’s Mask collection. It’s a multimedia AR experience. The user can experience a Met Masquerade through mobile phone, desktop, or even a large exhibition screen. This app will find a random mask from the Met's collection and put it on the face that the camera detects. The user can save photos or record a video of it. The user will also be able to learn the background information about the Mask they wear.  </p>

    <p>This web-based application is made by using DeepAR SDK. It is capable of tracking multi faces simultaneously. By swiping left or right, the user can try on different masks. They can also take a selfie, or check out and learn the detail information about the antique masks they wear. </p>
